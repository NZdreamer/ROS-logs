# Summary

I'm using Ubuntu 16.04, ROS kinetic, UR5e in URSim_VIRTUAL-5.8.2 and real UR5

I'm facing a strange problem when tring to use moveit! to control the robot.

# Impact

robot both vitual and real cannot be controlled by moveit! 

Initially, I succeed control the robot by ` rqt_joint_trajectory_controller` on vitual UR5e. 

But that failed on real UR5. Then I tried control robot by moveit!, also failed. Actually I succeed once among lots of failures without changing anything. 

# Issue details

First, launching the driver by

```
roslaunch ur_robot_driver ur5e_bringup.launch robot_ip:=192.168.42.100
```

the connnection establish and drop repeatedly every seconds, the terminal shows:


```

when tring to move the robot using plan and execute in moveit, the terminal shows:
